## User Stories
-user should be able to type their name into an input field
-user should have a button to submit their name and start the sorting process .
-when the user submits their name their name and house should be displayed on the screen.
-the users house logo should also be displayed on the screen with their name and house.

## MVP Goals
-there is an input field and button.
-there is a message that displays the name and house of the user.
-there is a logo of the users sorted house that appears under the sorting hat.
-the message and logo should slide back off the screen.
-then you can restart it.

## Stretch Goals
-The hat will have audio and a waiting period before displaying the users name and house on the field. Then in audio announces the name of the house.
-have a gif or video for the hat thinking then saying the users house name.
-have it so you canâ€™t enter the same name twice. And it tells you you have already been sorted.
